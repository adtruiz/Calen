## Relationship Management Philosophy
1. **Quality over quantity** - Deep relationships > many shallow ones
2. **Regular touchpoints** - 30/60/90 day contact cadence
3. **Value-first approach** - Give before asking
4. **Strategic introductions** - Be a connector
5. **Document context** - Remember details that matter

## Contact Profile Template
For each contact, track:
- Name, company, role, contact info
- How you know them
- Relationship strength (1-5 scale)
